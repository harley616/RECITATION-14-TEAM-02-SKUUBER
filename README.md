Skuuber: The Skiing Rideshare App

Vision: For avid skiers, snowboarders and backcountry hikers who need rides or new friends Skuuber is a website that will connect you to all of the above! Unlike Uber, our product will guarantee you sharing cars with a fellow skiing enthusiast who will share your passion for the powder!

Application Description: The User can login into site, with user profile and user friend list. Users can view a “personal” calendar with their ski/hike/snowboard rides planned. Users can view an “open” calendar with other people’s rides planned. Users can add themselves to other people’s rides if they are friends. Users can friend request another person. Weather given per each day, where we get the weather via an external weather API. This would allow the app to warn Users if there is inclement weather on a certain day.
